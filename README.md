### Project Description
Quackocalypse is a delightfully useless desktop app where a cute animated duck slowly descends into madness unless it‚Äôs fed every 10 seconds.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Because productivity is overrated, and sometimes‚Ä¶
you just need a DUCK that lays eggs in protest.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Because your desktop was far too calm‚Ä¶ until the DUCK arrived!!!

Workflow Breakdown
 1. Application Launch
Tkinter creates a borderless, full-screen transparent window

Loads and displays duck GIF (animated) and health bar

 2. Idle Loop & Animation
Runs loops for:

Duck animation every 100ms

Hunger check every 300ms

Health bar update every 100ms

Quack sound check every 800ms

 3. Hunger Monitoring
If no feeding for 5 seconds:

Enters hungry mode:

Duck starts growing

Moves randomly

Lays eggs on screen

 4. Chaos Mode
If duck reaches maximum size:

Enters chaos mode:

Movement accelerates

Egg drop rate increases exponentially

A prompt window appears

5. Prompt Behavior
Custom prompt asks: "So you won't feed me?"

Users can type a message:

‚Äúplease‚Äù / ‚Äúpls‚Äù ‚Üí app exits politely

Other phrases ‚Üí gets funny replies in bold

Close button is disabled (using overrideredirect)

Responses can be extended to include Malayalam phrases too

 6. Feeding the Duck
Clicking FEED ME button:

Resets duck size and position

Resets health bar

Removes all eggs

Exits hungry and chaos modes

Hides the prompt (if active)
