### Project Description
Quackocalypse is a delightfully useless desktop app where a cute animated duck slowly descends into madness unless it‚Äôs fed every 10 seconds.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Because productivity is overrated, and sometimes‚Ä¶
you just need a DUCK that lays eggs in protest.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Because your desktop was far too calm‚Ä¶ until the DUCK arrived!!!
